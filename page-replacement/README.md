#  Page Replacement Algorithms 

This repository contains Python implementations of the **most common Page Replacement Algorithms** used in Operating Systems to manage memory effectively.

---

##  What is Page Replacement?

Page replacement algorithms are used in **virtual memory systems** when a page of memory needs to be loaded but the available frames are full. These algorithms decide **which page to replace** to make room for the new one.

##  Algorithms Implemented

Each algorithm has its own folder with:

-  Python code
- User input support
-  Page fault and hit tracking
-  Code explanation
-  Individual README

###  1. FIFO â€“ First-Come, First-Served
- Removes the **oldest loaded** page first.
- Simple but can result in more faults.
- [Go to FIFO â†’](./Fifo)

### ðŸ”¹ 2. LRU â€“ Least Recently Used
- Removes the page that **hasnâ€™t been used for the longest time**.
- Smarter than FIFO.
- [Go to LRU â†’](./LRU)

### ðŸ”¹ 3. FCFS 
- A special folder to test FCFS logic in a scheduling-style view.
- [Go to FCFS â†’](./fcfs)
