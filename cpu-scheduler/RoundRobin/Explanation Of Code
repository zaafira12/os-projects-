##  Code Explanation

This section outlines the steps the Python code follows to simulate the scheduling algorithm.

# Step 1: Input number of processes, arrival & burst times

# Step 2: Input time quantum (fixed CPU time per process in one go)

# Step 3: Initialize:
# - rem_bt[] = Remaining burst times (copy of original BTs)
# - visited[] = Tracks whether a process has been added to the queue
# - queue = FIFO queue of process indices ready to run

# Step 4: Start the clock at time = 0
# - Add processes that have already arrived
# - For each process in queue:
#   - Run for min(quantum, remaining time)
#   - Add any new arrivals to the queue
#   - If not finished, re-add the current process to the end

# Step 5: After all are completed:
# - Calculate Completion Time, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time
# - Print the final table
