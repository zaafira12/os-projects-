## Code Explanation
This section outlines the steps the Python code follows to simulate the scheduling algorithm.


# Step 1: Input process count and details
# The user enters arrival time and burst time for each process.

# Step 2: Store all info as a list of (PID, AT, BT)
# Then sort this list by Arrival Time (since FCFS runs by order of arrival).

# Step 3: For each process (in order):
# - If the CPU is idle (time < arrival), we wait
# - Compute Completion Time: current time + burst time
# - Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
# - Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

# Step 4: Print a formatted table with all metrics
