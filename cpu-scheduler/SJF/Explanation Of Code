##  Code Explanation
This section outlines the steps the Python code follows to simulate the scheduling algorithm.

# Step 1: Input all process arrival times and burst times.

# Step 2: Store them in a list of tuples: (index, AT, BT)
# - Index is used to map results back to original process order.

# Step 3: Sort processes by (AT, BT)
# - This ensures shortest jobs that have already arrived are considered first.

# Step 4: For each time unit:
# - Pick the shortest job from those that have already arrived
# - Update current time
# - Calculate CT, TAT, WT

# Step 5: Print the final scheduling table
