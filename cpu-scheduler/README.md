# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project demonstrates basic CPU scheduling algorithms using Python.

##  About CPU Scheduling

CPU scheduling is the process of determining which process in the ready queue is to be allocated the CPU next. It is a key part of operating systems to improve CPU utilization and system responsiveness.

##  Included Scheduling Algorithms

- [FCFS - First Come First Serve](./FCFS)
- [SJF - Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)](./SJF)
- [Round Robin](./RoundRobin)

Each folder includes:
- Python source code
- Sample input/output
- Explanation of the logic
