## Code Explanation

1. **Input:**
   - Number of processes `n`, resources `m`
   - Allocation matrix: current resource use by each process
   - Max matrix: max resources each process may need
   - Available array: resources currently available

2. **Need matrix** is calculated as:
Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocation[i][j]

3. **Safe State Check:**
- Repeatedly check if any process can finish with the current available resources.
- If yes, simulate its execution by releasing its resources back.
- If all processes can finish, the system is in a **safe state**,else **unsafe state**

4. **Output:**
- Whether the system is in a safe state.
- The safe sequence if one exists.
